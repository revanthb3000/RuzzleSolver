RuzzleSolver
============

Takes in a ruzzle input and solves it. Basic brute force method. A 4x4 grid ensures that it will work with ease at all times. Takes less than half a minute to give you an output. Wordlist used is the same as the one used by Ruzzle.

I've also put in an automatic swiper that works in conjunction with Bluestacks to swipe every possible word, thereby giving you an insane score !!
